# Fan Menus and Telescoping Menus
Experimental UI to improve desktop mouse interaction speed. You can see [video of these techniques](https://youtu.be/n6wfe6PSlBU)

## description
This repo contains Java, Flash and ActionScript source code for a few experiments in desktop menu efficiency. While Pie menus are faster to use than linear menus because the distance to travel is small than linear menus, users have to re-learn the locations of menus items around a circle. The main design driver here was to preserve the time-saving capacity of Pie menus, while maintaining the learnability of the current linear menu.

### Float menu example
This early example feels pretty rough, but definitely preserves the existing muscle memory by simply mirroring the menu location. It turns out it's just like a more awkward right-click so in the end not the best idea.

### Float button example
Another illsutration of the float menu concept, here showing a button rather than a menu. The concept is a little faster here than the float menu, but experimental data show that it was far slower than the linear menu.

### Fan Menu
This idea proved to be both faster than right click menus, and more learnable than pie menus. As a design it balances speed and learnability
